				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">This website aims to introduce all products from the Pla Highway series that were released from 1968 until 1974. Till today very little is known about the Pla Highway series, so Light Sleepers (LS) research team tirelessly researches the unknown areas of Pla Highway.</p>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">The Pla Highway series is believed to be the ancestor of all motorised cars manufactured by TOMY. The Pla Highway series was eventually replaced by the PLAROAD series in 1985. Pla Highway is advertised as a completely separate series of battery operated car toys from the Plarail toy train line in its initial days, however Plarail and Pla Highway collaboration sets have been manufactured since 1972. Since then, people always wonder what the early days of Pla Highway really were. This is where this musuem comes in, to educate readers about the history of Pla Highway.</p>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">The choice of vehicles in the Pla Highway series, like the Toyota Corona 1600S Hardtop and the Nissan Datsun Bluebird 510, were manufactured based on real life Japanese vehicles. Exported Pla Highway also exists and this raises a question whether a patrol Bluebird car actually existed outside Japan. There were exclusive American car models looking like a Dodge or a Cadillac in the exported Pla Highway products and this needs more investigation.</p>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">Technical details: All Pla Highway products that do not collaborate with Plarail never had an ST合格番号 of "G-nn" or "N-nn", and those products manufactured during 1968 had a TP付番 of TP-19nnn. All non Plarail collaboration products manufactured after 1970 do not have numbering of any sort, but only a PAT.P number (patent number).</p>
