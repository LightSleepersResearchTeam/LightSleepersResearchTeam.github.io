				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">When the Pla Highway series was released in 1968, little did people know that Double Highway was also released as part of the Pla Highway series in the same year. Here is the catch: Double Highway is never recognised as its own series, but rather as part of the already known Pla Highway series because the logo on the box indicates that the Pla Highway logo and series is directly involved. In other words, Double Highway is a line of products originating from the original Pla Highway series, not a separate series. The Double Highway line has it's own product catalogue, which is distinct from the original Pla Highway catalogue. The first sighting of Double Highway is made known by a certain YouTuber. The Double Highway line has no single item releases, and only 2 confirmed set item releases, "ダブルハイウェイNO.1" and "ダブルハイウェイNO.2", were released. According to Vio, a Japanese owner of an old toy shop who offered Vio a contract to purchase "プラハイウェイNO.2" told a rumour that very little quantities of Double Highway products were manufactured and released. The store owner also once forsaw the possibility of the excavation of "ダブルハイウェイNO.2", and this rumour is confirmed when the set was exhibited in the auctions on 18/09/2022. According to なみだ9's grandfather, he had witnessed Double Highway in action from his friends who lives in a rural area where cars are a dream commodity among the residents. The Double Highway line also differs in the original Pla Highway line where the rails are now in light blue colour instead of the usual cream/white colour. It is believed that Double Highway served as a transitional product to the newer generation of Pla Highway as light blue coloured rails originated from Double Highway. Several changes can be seen compared to the original Pla Highway products. For example: The lever of the point rail was manufactured from a new mold, and the vehicles received a completely new type of dolly manufactured from a new mold. According to Zwilling, assembling double highway layouts are difficult due to the awkward dimensions of the outer curve of the "ダブルきょくせん", so using 2 point rails & 1 U turn rail or 4 point rails are neccessary in order to correct the orientation of the layout.</p><br>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">Speaking in technical detail, both sets have a TP-19nnn TOMY fiscal year numbering which indicates the year 1969 just like the original Pla Highway series products, however the series was released in 1968 according to the "トミー75年史 : 真の国際優良企業を目指して" book which is an official source of information. It can be concluded that both product lines were manufactured in 1968. Currently there are 2 confirmed surviving "ダブルハイウェイNO.1" and 3 confirmed surviving "ダブルハイウェイNO.2" as of 9/12/2022. We are constantly on the lookout for more surviving Double Highway products, so please contact us if you have other surviving Double Highway products in hand.</p>
