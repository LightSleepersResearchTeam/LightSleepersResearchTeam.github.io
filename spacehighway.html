				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">A product that doesn't even look like a Pla Highway product at first glance, but actually is. Hence this is so called a secret Pla Highway product. It's existence is first known from a YouTube video, and as of writing this review there are only 2 surviving sets in the world. The most interesting part is the Pla Highway logo is not seen anywhere on the box and packaging unlike Double Highway NO.2, effectively not counting this product as part of the Pla Highway series. This product is also not mentioned in the official source of information「トミー75年史 : 真の国際優良企業を目指して」, so the year of manufacture is unknown from there. Taking all these factors in, Space Highway is hands down the rarest Pla Highway product that ever existed. According to the TP-19023 numbering, this set was manufactured in 1969, however Pla Highway NO.2 acts as an argument to this theory since it was manufactured in 1968 and has TP-19nnn numbering. In final conclusion, Space Highway is manufactured in 1968.</p>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">The inner tray of Space Highway defies the tradition and trend of manufactured general Plarail and Pla Highway products at that time as it is 100% cardboard. Yes, you saw that correctly: <b>100% CARDBOARD and no plastic inner trays</b>. 2 individual cardboard trays are slotted in the box, and the contents are tied to the tray with a plastic-coated metal band. The logo and product name sticker on the upper tray is extremely valuable. It is a little troublesome to remove the piers from the lower box as the fitting is a little too tight, and there is a specific order of removing and putting back the piers.</p>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">The most notable contents about Space Highway are basically everything, from the translucent rails to the vehicle. However the most interesting things are the tall piers and the tunnel that offers features that other Pla Highway products don't have. To my surprise, the space piers were manufactured according to the height standards of a normal Pla Highway pier. These unique piers offer level 3 elevation in a layout without the need of つなぎ・はしげた部品NO.5 though level 3 elevation is rarely implemented in a layout. The tunnel offers a very unique feature that allows perpedicular elevation of rails without the need of a pier that obstructs the rail below. Think of this tunnel like the TOMICA WORLD 7522 Road & Rail Tunnel, but supports 2 Pla Highway rails. However it is troublesome to assemble the layout due to how the pier is designed, and the tunnel when mounted on a rail ends up being slightly taller than a normal Pla Highway pier and this causes even more problems like floating rails in a layout. The concept of this idea is really well thought out, but the execution is undeniably poor.</p>
				<p align="center" style="line-height: 2;">The vehicle is an unnamed spaceship that runs on 2 AA sized batteries, and has a small light bulb that turns on when the power is turned on. The gearbox is different from other Pla Highway vehicles, and it's design allows an easy 8-tooth gear replacement without needing to remove the gearbox from the chassis. The motor is different from other Pla Highway and Plarail vehicles, and it works perfectly with 1.6V batteries during my testing procedures. The spaceship cannot operate all gimmick rails due to its chassis design, and this trait is in line with other Pla Highway vehicles manufactured before the Double Highway product line. It is unknown if a single item spaceship exists, nor if a Space Highway catalogue exists. In conclusion, Space Highway sits at the pinnacle of anomalies with its sheer rarity and uniqueness that no other Pla Highway and Plarail product can offer.</p>
